Before you bite into a chocolate bar1 or take a sip of hot cocoa , consider , where did it come from ?
I sat at the orange wooden bar3 and asked for an absent .
You keep going in these bars2 .
There were no free tables , so I sat at the bar3 .
I waited for her in the Bar2 , the only bar2 in this sleepy village .
I used to go in this bar2 and to sip chocolate milkshake at an orange wooden bar3 biting into a chocolate bar1 .
