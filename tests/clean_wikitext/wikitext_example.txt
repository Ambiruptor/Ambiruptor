'''Lesser Poland''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Małopolska'', [[Latin]]: ''Polonia Minor'') is a historical region (''dzielnica'') of [[Poland]]; its capital is the city of [[Kraków]].

It should not be confused with the modern [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]], which covers only the south-western part of Lesser Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biotka.mol.uj.edu.pl/ho-conference/html/krakow.html|work=Heme Oxygenases 2007 Conference|publisher=[[Jagiellonian University]]|title=About Kraków|accessdate=14 August 2007}}</ref> Historical Lesser Poland is much bigger than the current [[Voivodeship (Poland)|voivodeship]] which bears its name, stretching from [[Bielsko-Biała]] in the south-west as far as to [[Siedlce]] in the north-east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/web/geography/regions/malopolska/link.shtml|title=Malopolska (Little Poland)|publisher=University at Buffalo, [[SUNY]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> It consisted of three voivodeships with the capitals in [[Kraków]], [[Sandomierz]] and [[Lublin]]. It has almost 60,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and about 9,000,000 inhabitants. Its landscape is mainly hilly, with [[Carpathian Mountains|Karpaty]] mountains in the south; it is located it the basin of upper [[Vistula]]. It has been famous for its mighty [[aristocracy]] (''[[magnat]]eria'') and rich [[nobility]] (''średnia [[szlachta]]'').

In the wider sense (see [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]]), Lesser Poland encompassed from the 14th century also [[Ruś Czerwona]], and from 16th century [[Podlasie]] and [[Ukraine]].

In the era of partitions its southern part was [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], which sometimes used to be called incorrectly Lesser Poland. As a result of this long-lasting division, many inhabitants of the northern part of the pre-partition region of Poland (with such cities as Lublin, [[Radom]], [[Kielce]] and [[Częstochowa]]) have lost their Lesser Poland's identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288|last=Podraza|first=Antoni|title=Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś|publisher=Wspólnota Małopolska|date=1 June 1999|quote=Czy dzisiejszy mieszkaniec Kielc, Radomia albo Lublina poczuwa się do tego, że pochodzi z Małopolski?

== Geography and boundaries ==
[[File:ProwincjaMalopolska.png|thumb|right|[[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]] in the widest meaning &ndash; with [[Red Ruthenia]], [[Podlachia]], and [[Kijowszczyzna]]]]

Lesser Poland lies in the upper confluence of the [[Vistula]] river and covers a large upland, including the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]] with the [[Kraków-Częstochowa Upland]] further west, [[Małopolska Upland]], [[Sandomierz Basin]], and [[Lublin Upland]]. Unlike other historical parts of the country, such as [[Kujawy]], [[Mazovia]], [[Podlachia]], [[Pomerania]], or [[Greater Poland]], Lesser Poland is mainly hilly, with Poland's highest peak, [[Rysy]], located within the borders of the province. Flat are northern and central areas of the province – around [[Tarnobrzeg]], [[Stalowa Wola]], [[Radom]] and [[Siedlce]], also valleys of the main rivers – the Vistula, the [[Pilica (river)|Pilica]], and the [[San (river)|San]]. Apart from Rysy, there are several other peaks located in the province – [[Pilsko]], [[Babia Góra]], [[Turbacz]], as well as [[Łysica]] in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Southern part of the province is covered by the [[Carpathian Mountains]], which are made of smaller ranges, such as [[Pieniny]], [[Tatra Mountains|Tatry]], and [[Beskids|Beskidy]].

Almost whole area is located in the Vistula Basin, with the exception of western and southern parts, belonging to the [[Oder|Odra]] and [[Danube|Dunaj]] Basins. Main rivers of the province are the Vistula, upper [[Warta]], [[Soła]], [[Skawa]], [[Raba (river)|Raba]], [[Dunajec]], [[Wisłok]], [[Wisłoka]], [[San (river)|San]], [[Wieprz]], [[Przemsza]], [[Nida (river)|Nida]], [[Kamienna (river)|Kamienna]], [[Radomka]], and Pilica. Major lakes of the province are: [[Lake Rożnów]], [[Lake Czchów]], [[Lake Dobczyce]], [[Lake Czorsztyn]], [[Lake Czaniec]], [[Lake Międzybrodzie]], [[Lake Klimkówka]] and [[Żywiec Lake]]. Most of them are man-made reservoirs.

Lesser Poland stretches from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in the south to Pilica and [[Liwiec]] rivers to the north. It borders Mazovia to the north, [[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlaskie]] to the northeast, [[Red Ruthenia]] to the east, [[Slovakia]] to the south, [[Silesia]] to the west, and Greater Poland to the northwest. Currently, the region is divided between Polish [[voivodeship]]s – [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] (whole), Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (whole), [[Silesian Voivodeship]] (eastern half), [[Podkarpackie Voivodeship]] (western part), [[Masovian Voivodeship]] (southern part), [[Łódź Voivodeship]] (southeastern corner), and [[Lublin Voivodeship]] (western part).

In Silesian Voivodeship, the border between [[Silesia]] and Lesser Poland is easy to draw, because with few exceptions, it goes along boundaries of local [[powiat|counties]]. In the south, it goes along western boundary of ancient [[Duchy of Teschen]], with the borderline along the [[Biała (Vistula)|Biała]] river, where [[Zwardoń]], [[Milówka]], and [[Rajcza]] are in Lesser Poland. [[Bielsko-Biała]] is a city made of two parts – Lesser Poland's Biala (also called ''Biala Krakowska''), makes eastern half of the city, and only in 1951 it merged with Silesian Bielsko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powiat-bielsko-biala.info/powiat|title=Bielsko-Biała – najważniejsze informacje|publisher=Powiat Bielsko-Biała|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref> Further north, the border goes along western boundaries of cities of [[Jaworzno]], and [[Sosnowiec]], along the [[Przemsza]] and [[Brynica]] rivers.

Historically, Lesser Poland was divided into two lands - Kraków Land and Sandomierz Land, both of which emerged after the [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty]]. In the 14th century, [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]] and [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]] were created, and in 1474, [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin Voivodeship]] was carved of three Sandomierz Voivodeship counties, located on the right bank of the [[Vistula]]. Historian Adolf Pawiński, who in the late 19th century was director of [[Polish Central Archives of Historical Records]], estimated in his book "Polska XVI wieku pod względem geograficzno-statystycznym", that the size of Kraków Voivodeship was 19,028&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Sandomierz Voivodeship had the area of 25,762&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>., and Lublin Voivodeship - 11,033&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Together with the [[Duchy of Siewierz]] (607&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.), and the parts of [[Spiš]] that belonged to Poland after the [[Treaty of Lubowla]] (1211&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.), total area of Lesser Poland was 57,640 square kilometers.<ref>[http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=1814&from=publication Adolf Pawiński, Polska XVI wieku pod względem geograficzno-statystycznym. Tom III, Małopolska. Warszawa 1886]</ref> Apart from the three historic lands, Lesser Poland has other smaller regions, such as [[Podhale]], [[Nida River#Ponidzie|Ponidzie]], and [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]].

== Origin of the name ==
[[Zygmunt Gloger]] in his work ''Historical geography of land of ancient Poland'' (''Geografia historyczna ziem dawnej Polski'') states that according to a Polish custom, whenever a new village was formed next to an older one, the name of the new entity was presented with an adjective ''little'' (or ''lesser''), while the old village was described as ''greater''. The same procedure was used in naming these two Polish provinces{{snds}}the "older" one, the cradle of the Polish state, was called ''Greater Poland'', while her "younger sister", which became part of Poland a few years later, was called ''Lesser Poland''. The name Greater Poland (''Polonia Maior'') was for the first time used in 1242, by princes Boleslaw and [[Przemysł I of Greater Poland|Przemysław I]], who named themselves ''Duces Majoris Poloniae'' (''Princes of the Older Poland'').{{sfn|Gloger|1903|p=170}} Lesser Poland, or ''Polonia Minor'', appeared for the first time in historical documents in 1493, in the [[Statutes of Piotrków]], during the reign of King [[Jan Olbracht]],<ref>[http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=2004047 Jerzy Krasuski, Inne spojrzenie na początki Polski.

[[File:Sokolica a1.jpg|thumb|[[Pieniny|Pieniny National Park]].]]

=== Early period and Kingdom of Poland ===
In the first years of Polish statehood, southern Lesser Poland was inhabited by the [[Slavs|Slavic tribe]] of [[Vistulans]], with two major centers in Kraków and [[Wiślica]]. Their land, which had probably been part of [[Great Moravia]], and [[Bohemia]],{{sfn|Lerski|1996|p=309}} was annexed by [[Mieszko I of Poland]] some time in the late 10th century. Cosmas of Prague in his ''Chronicle of Bohemians'' wrote: "Polish prince Mieszko, a cunning man, seized by ruse the city of Kraków, killing with sword all Czechs he found there".{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2006|p=155}} Northern part of Lesser Poland (Lublin and Sandomierz) was probably inhabited by another tribe, the [[Lendians]],<ref>[http://www.wyklady.ekpu.lublin.pl/wyklady/segedaew4.htm Kievan Rus and the Old Polish state: historical parallels]"Lendizi (Lędzianie), who, according to G. Lovmyansky, inhabited Sandomierz–Lublin area"</ref> and dr [[Antoni Podraza]], historian of the [[Jagiellonian University]] claims that ancient division of Lesser Poland into two major parts – Land (Duchy) of Kraków, and Land (Duchy) of Sandomierz, is based on the existence of two Slavic tribes in the area.<ref>[http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288 Antoni Podraza, Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś]"Można sądzić, że pierwotny podział Małopolski na dwie części, krakowską i sandomierską, wiąże się właśnie z istnieniem nie jednego, a dwóch plemion na tym obszarze"</ref> However, exact location of the Lendians has not been determined to this day. Some historians speculate that they occupied Red Ruthenia, and their center was in [[Przemyśl]].{{sfn|Labuda|1988|pp=167–211}}
Around the year 1000, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków]] was created, and its borders covered whole area of Lesser Poland. During the reign of [[Casimir I the Restorer]], Kraków for the first time became the capital of Poland (around 1040), since Greater Poland and [[Silesia]], with main Polish urban centers, such as [[Gniezno]] and [[Poznań]] were ravaged by Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] of [[Bohemia]].<ref>[http://www.malopolskie.iap.pl/?id=30876&location=f&msg=1 Official portal of Lesser Poland Voivodeship] "W roku 1038 Polske najechal czeski ksiaze Brzetyslaw I. Zajal i ograbil Wielkopolske, Slask i Malopolske, zdewastowal takze Gniezno. Jednym z waznych niezniszczonych osrodków ówczesnej Polski byl Kraków, gdzie, po zwyciestwie nad Brzetyslawem, Kazimierz Odnowiciel przeniósl swoja siedzibe."</ref> In 1138, following the [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty]], the country was divided between his sons (see also [[Fragmentation of Poland]]). [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] created the [[Seniorate Province]], which, among others, consisted of Kraków. At the same time, Lesser Poland was divided into two parts, when its eastern part formed the [[Duchy of Sandomierz]],<ref>[http://www.staypoland.com/cityHistory.aspx?TownId=67 StayPoland portal. History of Sandomierz] "In his will, King Bolesław Krzywousty declared Sandomierz to be the capital of a duchy."</ref> carved by the ruler for his son [[Henry of Sandomierz]].
During the fragmentation period, both lands of Lesser Poland were frequently ruled by the same prince. Among them were [[Bolesław IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]], [[Casimir II the Just]], [[Leszek I the White]], [[Bolesław V the Chaste]], [[Leszek II the Black]], [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]], and [[King of Bohemia]], [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]], who united Lesser Poland in 1290/1291. The province was pillaged during the Mongol invasion of Poland, when a combined army of Kraków and Sandomierz was destroyed by [[Baidar]] in the [[Battle of Chmielnik]]. The loss was so heavy that [[Norman Davies]] wrote: "At Chmielnik, the assembled nobility of Małopolska perished to a man."{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=71}} During their [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259]], and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287]] invasions, the Mongols burned major cities of Lesser Poland, killing thousands of people. Furthermore, the province, especially its northeastern part, was often raided by the [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[Rus' (people)|Rusyns]], [[Yotvingians]], and [[Old Prussians]]. The city of Lublin suffered most frequently – among others, it was burnt by the Rusyns in 1244, the Lithuanians 1255, the Prussians in 1266, and the Yotvingians in 1282.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnn.pl/Konflikty_przygraniczne_1241_-_1288,2752.html |title=History of Lublin, Border conflicts 1241–1288 |publisher=Tnn.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Another center of the province, Sandomierz, was destroyed by the Tartars in 1260,{{sfn|Bedford|2008|p=224}} and burnt by the Lithuanians in 1349.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dziedzictwo.ekai.pl/@@sandomierz_katedra |title=The cathedral of Sandomierz |publisher=Dziedzictwo.ekai.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>

Unlike other Polish provinces, especially [[Silesia]], Lesser Poland did not undergo further fragmentation, and in the early 14th century became the core of the reunited nation (together with Greater Poland).<ref>[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no15_ses/13_purchla.pdf Malopolska or Galicia. Cracow's Dilemmas in Central Europe, by Jacek Purchla] (pdf format)</ref> The period of nation's fragmentation came to a symbolic end on 30 January 1320, when [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] was crowned as [[King of Poland]]. The ceremony took place in Kraków's [[Wawel Cathedral]], and the king of the reunited country decided to choose Kraków as the capital. Through 14th and 15th centuries, Lesser Poland's position as the most important province of the nation was cemented. It became visible during the reign of [[Casimir III the Great]], who favored less known Lesser Poland's noble families, at the expense of Greater Poland's nobility.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grzesiek Supeł |url=http://www.wiw.pl/historia/poczet/termin.asp?et=kazimierz_wielki |title=Kings of Poland – Kazimierz Wielki |publisher=Wiw.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> The reign of Casimir the Great was a period of growing prosperity of Lesser Poland. With high density of population, fertile soils and rich deposits of minerals (especially salt in [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]], as well as lead in [[Olkusz]]), the province was the richest part of Poland. After annexation of [[Red Ruthenia]], Lesser Poland lost its status of the borderland, and both regions created an economic bridge between Poland and the ports of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Lerski|1996|p=309}} The king, who drew Jewish [[Casimir III the Great#Relationship with Polish Jews|settlers from across Europe to his country]], built several castles along western border of Lesser Poland, with the most notable ones in [[Skawina]], [[Pieskowa Skała]], [[Będzin Castle|Będzin]], [[Lanckorona]], [[Olkusz]], [[Lelów]], [[Bobolice Castle|Bobolice]], [[Krzepice]], [[Ogrodzieniec]], [[Ojców]], [[Olsztyn, Silesian Voivodeship|Olsztyn]], [[Bobolice]], [[Mirów, Silesian Voivodeship|Mirów]] (see also [[Eagle Nests Trail]]).

In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], Lesser Poland was made of three [[voivodeship]]s – [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]], [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]], and [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin Voivodeship]], created in 1474 out of eastern part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship.<ref name="nowamalopolska.pl">[http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288 Antoni Podraza, Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś.

The only exception was large part of contemporary [[Upper Silesia]] (the area around [[Bytom]], [[Toszek]], [[Siewierz]], and [[Oświęcim]]), which belonged to Duchy of Kraków until 1179. In that year, prince of Kraków [[Casimir II the Just]], handed these lands to Prince of [[Opole]] [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bytom.pl/pl/9/1197155410/1197128419/4 |title=History of Bytom |publisher=Bytom.pl |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> The [[Duchy of Siewierz]], ruled since 1443 by the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], merged with Lesser Poland in 1790. Other Silesian realms lost in 1179, also returned to Lesser Poland – [[Duchy of Zator]] (in 1513), and [[Duchy of Oświęcim]] (1564). Both duchies merged into a Silesian County of the Kraków Voivodeship, and shared the fate of Lesser Poland. Apart from Jews, among other ethnic minorities of the province were the [[Walddeutsche]], who settled the borderland of Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia (14th through 17th centuries). In the Middle Ages, the Germans inhabited several cities of Lesser Poland, especially Kraków and Sandomierz (see [[Rebellion of wójt Albert]]).

In the late [[Middle Ages]], Lesser Poland gradually became the center of Polish statehood,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.poland.com/texts/en/t-ap-4-1.php|title=LESSER POLAND|publisher=Poland.com portal|accessdate=19 April 2011|quote=However, already by the mid-11th century Lesser Poland had risen in status to be Poland's principal province.}}</ref> with Kraków being the capital of the country from the mid-11th century until 1596. Its nobility ruled Poland when [[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] was too young to control the state, and the [[Union of Krewo]] with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was the brainchild of Lesser Poland's [[szlachta]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://historia.gazeta.pl/historia/1,99863,6713823,krolowa_Jadwiga_Andegawenska.html|newspaper=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|title=Królowa Jadwiga Andegaweńska|first=Martyna|last=Bandurewicz|date=12 June 2009|quote=Ze względu na małoletniość Jadwigi rządy w jej imieniu sprawowali możnowładcy małopolscy.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Lesser Poland remained the most important part of the country. After the death of Casimir the Great, Lesser Poland's nobility promoted [[Louis I of Hungary]] as the new king, later supporting his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland]] in exchange for [[Privilege of Koszyce]]. Since Jadwiga, crowned on 16 October 1384, was too young to rule the country, Poland was in fact governed by the Lesser Poland's nobility, who decided to find her a husband, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Jogaila]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historia.gazeta.pl/historia/1,99863,6713823,krolowa_Jadwiga_Andegawenska.html |title=Królowa Jadwiga Andegaweƒska, by Martyna Bandurewicz, Gazeta Wyborcza, 12 June 2009 |publisher=Historia.gazeta.pl |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Consequently, unions of Poland and Lithuania at [[Union of Krewo|Krewo]] and [[Union of Horodło|Horodło]] were the brainchildren of Lesser Poland's nobility,<ref>[http://www.omp.org.pl/index.php?module=subjects&func=viewpage&pageid=615 Wladyslaw Konopczynski – O idei jagielloƒskiej] "Unia krewska i horodelska byly dzielem panów malopolskich"</ref> among whom the most influential individuals were [[Spytek z Melsztyna (died 1399)|Spytek z Melsztyna]], and cardinal [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Olesnicki]]. Other famous Lesser Poland's families are [[Lubomirski family]], [[Kmita family]], [[Tarnowski family]], [[Potocki family]], [[Sobieski family]], [[Koniecpolski family]], [[Ossolinski family]], [[Poniatowski family]].

Since Lesser Poland was the most important province of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|the country]], several important events took place on its territory. In 1364, Casimir the Great called the [[Congress of Kraków]], and in 1401, the [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] was signed. In 1505 in Radom, the Sejm adopted the [[Nihil novi]] title, which forbade the King to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. In the same year, also in the same city, Polish law was codified in the [[Łaski's Statute]], and the [[Crown Tribunal]] (the highest appeal court in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom) held its sessions in Lublin. In 1525, the [[Treaty of Kraków]] was signed, ending the [[Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521)|Polish–Teutonic War]]. Lesser Poland also is home to the oldest Polish university – the [[Jagiellonian University]], founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great, and several outstanding figures of early Polish culture were born here, such as [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Mikołaj Rej]], [[Jan z Lublina]], [[Mikołaj Gomółka]], [[Maciej Miechowita]], [[Marcin Kromer]], [[Łukasz Górnicki]], and [[Mikołaj Radomski]].

=== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
In the 16th century, Lesser Poland retained its position as the most important province of the country. As no major conflicts took place on its territory, it was the center of [[Renaissance in Poland]]. The province was home to numerous scholars, writers and statesmen, and it was here where [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was created in 1569 (see [[Union of Lublin]]). In the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland proper was the base of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown|Province of Lesser Poland]], which covered southern lands of the vast country. The province was made of Lesser Poland itself, also [[Red Ruthenia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]], and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] voivodeships – [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kijów Voivodeship]], [[Chernihiv Voivodeship|Czernihów Voivodeship]], and [[Bracław Voivodeship]], which, until 1569, had been part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

The period in Polish history known as the [[Polish Golden Age]] was very fortunate for Lesser Poland. Kings of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], especially [[Sigismund I the Old]] (himself born in Lesser Poland's [[Kozienice]]), and his son [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (born in Kraków), resided in Kraków, which was the capital of the immense Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lesser Poland's prosperity was reflected in numerous examples of [[Renaissance]] architecture complexes, built across the province. In 1499, hiherto [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wawel Castle]] was damaged in a fire, and a few years later, Sigismund I, with help of the best native and foreign artists (such as Francesco the Florentine, Bartholomeo Berrecci or Niccolo Castiglione<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krakow-poland.com/Tourist-Attractions/Wawel-Castle-Krakow,he |title=Wawel – the Seat of Kings |publisher=Krakow-poland.com |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>) refurbished the complex into a splendid Renaissance palace. Furthermore, in the early 16th century, several palaces were built in Lesser Poland – in [[Drzewica]], [[Szydłowiec]], [[Ogrodzieniec]], and [[Pieskowa Skała]]. The province became rich mostly due to the grain trade, conducted along the Vistula, and among cities which prospered in the 16th century, there are Kraków, Sandomierz, Lublin, [[Kazimierz Dolny]], [[Pilzno]], [[Tarnów]], Radom, [[Biecz]]. In later years of the 16th century, further palaces were built or remodelled in [[Baranow Sandomierski]], and [[Niepołomice]].
[[File:Pieskowa Skala 23.jpg|thumb|[[Pieskowa Skała]].]]
In the early 16th century, [[Protestant Reformation]] spread across the Commonwealth, and Lesser Poland became one of early centers of the movement, when students from [[Wittenberg]] brought the news to Cracow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/westciv/reformat/poland.htm |title=Dr. E. L. Skip Knox, The Reformation in Poland. Boise State University |publisher=Boisestate.edu |date=18 August 2000 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> In the first years of the century, professor of Jagiellonian University Jakub of [[Iłża]] (Jakub z Ilzy, died 1542) became one of the main promoters of the movement in the region. He actively supported the notions of [[Martin Luther]], and in 1528 was called to the Bishop of Kraków's court. Convinced of heresy, he was forced to leave Poland in 1535. Reformation soon became very popular among Lesser Poland's nobility, especially [[Calvinism]], and according to one estimate, some 20% of local [[szlachta]] converted from Roman Catholicism.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marek Kurkierewicz |url=http://www.magazyn.ekumenizm.pl/content/article/20041209161417737.htm |title=Marek Kurkierewicz, Reformacja na ziemiach polskich, published in Magazyn Teologiczny Semper Reformanda |publisher=Magazyn.ekumenizm.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> They were attracted by Calvinism's democratic character, and Lesser Poland's center of the movement was set in the town of [[Pińczów]], which came to be known as ''Sarmatian Athens''. It was in Pińczów, where a local nobleman converted a Roman Catholic parish into a Protestant one, opened a Calvinist Academy, and published its Antitrinitarian confession in 1560 and in 1561.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/hillarsocinian1.htm |title=ocinian Precursors of the American Constitutional Separation of Church and State by Marian Hillar, Houston, Texas |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Several Calvinist synods took place in Lesser Poland – the first one in [[Słomniki]] (1554), Pińczów (the first united Synod of Poland and Lithanian – 1556{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=143}} 1561), and Kraków (1562). In 1563, also in Pińczów, the so-called [[Brest Bible]] was translated into Polish language. In 1570, the [[Sandomierz Agreement]] was signed by a number of Protestant groups, with the exception of the [[Polish Brethren]], another religious group very influential in Lesser Poland. The Brethren had their center in Lesser Poland's village of [[Raków, Kielce County|Raków]], where a main Arian printing press, as well as a college, known as Akademia Rakowska (''Gymnasium Bonarum Artium'') founded in 1602 were located. Among distunguished European scholars associated with the school, there were [[Johannes Crellius]], [[Corderius]], and [[Valentinus Smalcius]] (who translated into German the [[Racovian Catechism]]).

In 1572, the Jagiellon dynasty died out, and next year, [[Henry III of France]] became first elected king of the country. After his short reign, and [[War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588)]], which also took place in Lesser Poland, the new ruler was [[Stephen Báthory of Poland]], who died in 1586. The ruler from [[Transylvania]] was followed by [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Sweden, whose election marked gradual decline of the province. Sigismund's eyes were set on Sweden, and for many years he concentrated his efforts on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne (see [[Polish–Swedish union]], [[War against Sigismund]]). Therefore, Lesser Poland, located in southwestern corner of the Commonwealth, began to lose its importance, which was marked in 1596, when Sigismund moved his permanent residence, court and the crown headquarters to centrally-located Warsaw.<ref>[http://www.warsawhotelstart.com/ Tourist Information – Warsaw Hotel Start] "Its central location was the main reason for holding royal elections here. After Wawel Castle in Cracow burnt down, King Zygmunt III Waza moved his permanent residence, court and the crown headquarters from Cracow to Warsaw in 1596."</ref>

Even though first half of the 17th century was filled with wars, all major conflicts did not reach Lesser Poland, and the province continued to prosper, which was reflected in its castles and palaces, such as the enormous [[Krzyztopor]]. Apart from minor wars, such as [[Zebrzydowski Rebellion]], and [[Kostka-Napierski Uprising]], the province remained safe. [[Cossack]]s of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] reached as far west as [[Zamość]] and [[Lwów]], but did not enter Lesser Poland. The province did not witness other wars, such as [[Polish-Swedish War of 1625-1629]], [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)]], [[Polish–Ottoman War (1620–1621)]], and [[Smolensk War]]. Nevertheless, Lesser Poland's nobility took active part in these conflicts – [[Marina Mniszech]], the daughter of Voivode of Sandomierz, [[Jerzy Mniszech]], was wife of [[False Dmitriy I]], as well as [[False Dmitry II]]. Furthermore, Lesser Poland's lands, especially its northeastern part, became a base for Polish troops, fighting the Cossacks, and King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] often stayed in Lublin with his court, preparing military campaigns in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnn.pl/Powstanie_Chmielnickiego_w_Lublinie_1648_%E2%80%93_1655,2788.html |title=Chmielnicki Uprising in Lublin 1648–1655 |publisher=Tnn.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> The situation changed with the outbreak of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. In October 1655, the Russo-Cossack armies under [[Ivan Vyhovsky]] entered eastern Lesser Poland, reaching the Vistula, and pillaging Lublin, [[Puławy]], and [[Kazimierz Dolny]]. The invaders quickly retreated, but a few months later, Lesser Poland was [[Deluge (history)|flooded]] by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]].

Swedish invasion of Poland had catastrophic consequences for the hitherto prosperous province. The attackers, supported by their allies from [[Transylvania]], seized whole Lesser Poland, reaching as far south as [[Nowy Targ]], [[Nowy Sącz]], and [[Żywiec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.pl/almanach/art-ludzie/pulkownik_mikolaj_giza.htm |title=Jerzy Giza.

The invaders seized the capital of Lesser Poland after a [[Siege of Kraków (1655)|short siege]], and their occupation of the province was confirmed after their victories in the [[Battle of Wojnicz]], and the [[Battle of Golab]]. In those years, one of the most important and symbolic events in the history of the nation took place in Lesser Poland. It was the [[Siege of Jasna Góra]], which, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. Furthermore, following the [[Treaty of Radnot]], Lesser Poland was invaded in January 1657 by [[George II Rákóczi]], whose troops caused more destruction. Foreign armies were not chased out of Lesser Poland until 1657, Kraków itself was recaptured on 18 August 1657. After these invasions, the province was ruined, with hundreds of villages, towns and cities burned. The population decreased (the urban population by nearly half<ref>Jaroslav Miller. ''Urban Societies in East-Central Europe''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. 2008. p. 31.</ref>), the peasantry starved, and like other parts of the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland was devastated. The period of peace lasted for about forty years, when in 1700, another major conflict, the [[Great Northern War]] began. Lesser Poland once again became a battleground, with [[Battle of Kliszów]] taking place there in 1702, and the [[Sandomierz Confederation]] formed in 1704.

After the conflict, Lesser Poland began a recovery, which was hampered by several other factors. Province's cities frequently burned (Lublin 1719, Nowy Targ 1784, Nowy Sącz, Dukla 1758, Wieliczka 1718, Miechów 1745, Drzewica), there also were numerous outbreaks of plagues and typhus (in 1707–1708, some 20,000 died in Kraków and its area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wawel.net/liczby_kleski.htm |title=Krakow in dates and figures |publisher=Wawel.net |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>)

Lesser Poland was one of main centers of the [[Bar Confederation]]. On 21 June 1786 in Kraków, local confederation was announced, and on the same day Voievode of Kraków, Michal Czarnocki, urged his citizens to join the movement. Soon afterwards, Kraków was captured by the Russian troops, and the center of Lesser Poland's insurgency moved to the mountainous south – areas around Dukla and Nowy Sącz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beskidniski.pl/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=258&page=2 |title=Beskid Niski – informacje regionalne |publisher=Beskidniski.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> During the Confederation, several battles and skirmishes took place there. In 1770, after the Battle of Iwonicz, the Russians ransacked Biecz. The movement ended in 1772, and its decline was connected with the [[Partitions of Poland]]. Another local center of the movement was [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] in Częstochowa, which was defended by [[Kazimierz Pulaski]] for almost two years (1770–1772).<ref>[http://www.krakow-info.com/czestoch.htm] "1770–1772: Jasna Góra was a fortress of anti-Russian Bar Confederation insurgents led by Kazimierz Pulaski, future American hero"</ref>

=== Partitions of Poland (1772–1918) ===
The [[Partitions of Poland]] began earlier in Lesser Poland than in other provinces of the country. In 1769, [[Austrian Empire]] annexed a small territory of [[Spisz]], and next year, the towns of [[Czorsztyn]], Nowy Sącz and Nowy Targ.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=393}} In 1771, the Russians and the Prussians agreed on the first partition of the country, and in early 1772, Austrian Emperor [[Maria Theresa]] decided to join the two powers. In the first partition of the Commonwealth, the Austrians seized the territory which would later be called [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and which included southwestern corner of Lesser Poland (south of the Vistula river), with Żywiec, Tarnów, and Biecz, but without major urban centers of the province, such as Kraków, Sandomierz, Radom, Lublin, Częstochowa, and Kielce.

[[File:Sandomierz Wisła Statki.jpg|thumb|Vistula in [[Sandomierz]].]]
Second Partition of Poland (1793) did not result in significant changes of boundaries in the area, as the Austrian Empire did not participate in it. However, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] moved on, and in 1793 they annexed northwestern corner of the province, together with the city of Częstochowa,<ref name="1909 guide" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Częstochowa – Local history|publisher=Museum of the History of Polish Jews|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/czestochowa/3,local-history/|quote=In 1793, Częstochowa found itself annexed to Prussia.|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> and its vicinity, which became part of the newly created province of [[South Prussia]]. Therefore, in late 1793, Lesser Poland was already divided between three countries – Austrian Empire (south of the Vistula), Kingdom of Prussia (Częstochowa and northwestern corner), and still existing Commonwealth. After the Third Partition (1795), most of Lesser Poland was annexed by Austria, with all major cities. Prussia managed to seize a small, western part of the province, with the towns of [[Siewierz]], [[Zawiercie]], [[Będzin]], and [[Myszków]], calling this land [[New Silesia]], while the Austrians decided to name newly acquired lands of northern Lesser Poland [[West Galicia]]. In 1803, West Galicia was merged with [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], but retained some autonomy. Lesser Poland was one of major centers of Polish resistance against the occupiers. On 24 March 1794 in Kraków, [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] announced the general insurrection (see [[Kosciuszko Uprising]]), mobilising all able males of Lesser Poland. Two weeks later, [[Battle of Raclawice]] took place, ending with a Polish victory. The uprising was suppressed by combined Prusso – Russian forces, and among battles fought in Lesser Poland, there is [[Battle of Szczekociny]].

During [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was created by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] out of Polish lands which had been granted to Prussia in the Partitions. In 1809, after the [[Polish-Austrian War]], and the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]], the Duchy was expanded, when northern Lesser Poland was added to its territory (with Kielce, Radom, and Lublin). Following the [[Congress of Vienna]], Duchy of Warsaw was turned into Russian-ruled [[Congress Poland]], and historical capital of the province, Kraków, was turned into [[Free City of Kraków]], which also included the towns of [[Trzebinia]], [[Chrzanów]], [[Jaworzno]], and [[Krzeszowice]]. In Congress Poland, the lands of Lesser Poland were initially divided between four palatinates – Palatinate of Kraków (with capital in Kielce), Palatinate of Sandomierz (with capital in Radom), Palatinate of Lublin, and Palatinate of Podlasie (with capital in Siedlce), (see also [[Administrative division of Congress Poland]]). Later, the palatinates were turned into [[Governorates of the Russian Empire|governorates]]. Thus, Russian part of Lesser Poland was divided into [[Kielce Governorate]], [[Lublin Governorate]], [[Radom Governorate]], [[Siedlce Governorate]], and [[Piotrków Governorate]] (western counties, with Częstochowa and industrial area of [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]]). Borders of these administrative units did not reflect historical boundaries of the province.

Most of the [[November Uprising]], which began in 1830, missed Lesser Poland, as major battles took place in the area around Warsaw. In early 1831, when Russian forces advanced into Congress Poland, some skirmishes took place in northern counties of the province – at Puławy, Kurow, and Kazimierz Dolny. In early 1846, a group of Polish patriots attempted a failed [[Kraków Uprising|uprising]] in the Free City of Kraków. The insurrection was quickly suppressed by the Austrian troops, and as a result, the Free City was annexed by the Austrian Empire. In the same year, Austrian part of Lesser Poland was witness to a massacre of Polish nobility by the peasantry, known as [[Galician slaughter]]. The peasants, led by [[Jakub Szela]], murdered about 1000 nobles, and destroyed about 500 manors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3965088|title=rabacja galicyjska|publisher=Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> These events took place in three counties – [[Sanok]], [[Jasło]] and [[Tarnów]].

Northern and central Lesser Poland (the part of the province which was taken by the Russian Empire) was one of the main centers of the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864). In the first days of the insurrection, skirmishes with the Russian Army took place in such towns, as [[Łuków]], [[Kraśnik]], [[Szydłowiec]], [[Bodzentyn]], and [[Suchedniów]]. Since the Poles were poorly armed, the Russians did not have major problems with them, and soon afterwards, the insurrectionists decided to organize military camps. Among biggest camps in Lesser Poland, there were [[Ojców]] (3000 soldiers), and [[Wąchock]], where [[Marian Langiewicz]] gathered up to 1500 people. The uprising died out by early spring of 1864, and among counties where it continued for the longest time, was the extreme northeastern corner of Lesser Poland, around Łuków, where reverend [[Stanisław Brzóska]] was active. Since Russian military supremacy was crushing, the Poles were forced to limit their actions to guerilla warfare. Among the biggest battles which took place in Lesser Poland there are: Battle of [[Szydłowiec]] (23 January 1863); Battle of [[Miechów]] (17 February 1863); Battle of [[Małogoszcz]] (24 February 1863); Battle of [[Staszów]] (17 February 1863); Battle of [[Pieskowa Skała]] (4 March 1863); two Battles of [[Opatów]] (25 November 1863, 21 February 1864).

As a result of their support of the failed insurrection, several Lesser Poland's towns lost their charters and were turned into villages. Among them were [[Kraśnik]],<ref>[http://www.lubelskie.info.pl/index.php?i=110&d=105]{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Bodzentyn]], [[Opatów]], [[Iłża]], [[Małogoszcz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malogoszcz.pl/asp/pl_start.asp?typ=14&sub=2&menu=10&strona=1|publisher=Gmina Mologoszcz|title=Historia miasta|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> [[Wąchock]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://b.1asphost.com/Custer/wachock.html|title=Powiat Stachowicki|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> [[Busko-Zdrój]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kppspbusko.hg.pl/theme/page/historia%20miasta.html|title=Historia miasta|publisher=KOMENDA POWIATOWA; PAŃSTWOWEJ STRAŻY POŻARNEJ; W BUSKU – ZDROJU|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref> Jędrzejów,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep-ow/PLI/ft/am/jedrz.htm |title=Jędrzejów, historia |language=pl |publisher=Ee.pw.edu.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> [[Cmielow]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.wyborcza.pl/temat/wyborcza/powstanie+styczniowe |title=POWSTANIE STYCZNIOWE – Gazeta Wyborcza – internetowe wydanie – Wyborcza.pl |language=pl |publisher=Info.wyborcza.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> [[Zwoleń]], [[Drzewica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drzewica.pl/portal.php?aid=12103248264824175a41ff7 |title=Gmina Drzewica |publisher=Drzewica.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> [[Wierzbica, Radom County|Wierzbica]],<ref>{{cite web|author=22 czerwiec 2008 |url=http://www.wierzbica.pl/ugwierzbica/?page_id=2 |title=» Historia Urząd Gminy w Wierzbicy: |publisher=Wierzbica.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> [[Czeladź]], [[Kazimierz Dolny]], [[Wolborz]], [[Stopnica]], [[Daleszyce]], [[Wiślica]], [[Pajęczno]], [[Lipsko]], [[Pacanów]], [[Ożarów]], [[Wolbrom]], [[Proszowice]], [[Nowe Miasto Korczyn]], [[Włoszczowa]], [[Przysucha]], [[Opole Lubelskie]].

[[File:Collegium Maius 07.JPG|thumb|right|In the 19th century, Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]] was a major center of Polish science and culture]]
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lesser Poland remained one of the centers of Polish culture, especially the city of Kraków, where Jagiellonian University was one of only two Polish-language colleges of that period (the other one was [[Lviv University|University of Lwów]]). Another significant center of national culture was the town of [[Puławy]], where in the late 18th century, a local palace owned by Czartoryski family became a museum of Polish national memorabilia and a major cultural and political centre. A number of prominent artists, both representing [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]], and [[Positivism in Poland|Positivism]] was born in Lesser Poland, including [[Wincenty Pol]] (born in Lublin), [[Stefan Żeromski]] (born near Kielce), [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] (born near Łuków in extreme northeast corner of Lesser Poland), [[Walery Przyborowski]] (born near Kielce), [[Piotr Michałowski]], [[Helena Modjeska]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]] (born in Lublin), [[Leon Wyczolkowski]] (born near Siedlce), [[Juliusz Kossak]] (born in [[Nowy Wiśnicz]]), [[Jozef Szujski]] (born in Tarnów). In the early 20th century, Lesser Poland, especially its part which belonged to Austria-Hungary, was a center of a cultural movement called [[Young Poland]]. Many artists associated with the movement were born in Lesser Poland, with the most prominent including [[Wladyslaw Orkan]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Jozef Mehoffer]], and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].

Since Austrian part of Poland enjoyed a wide autonomy, the province of Galicia, whose western part was made of Lesser Poland, became a hotbed of Polish conspirational activities. In anticipation of a future war, Galician Poles, with help of their brethren from other parts of the divided country, created several paramilitary organizations, such as [[Polish Rifle Squads]], and [[Riflemen's Association]]. The capital of Lesser Poland, Kraków, was a key center of pro-independence movements, with such individuals, as [[Jozef Pilsudski]], being actively involved in those activities. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, [[Polish Legions in World War I|Pilsudski's Legions]] crossed the Austrian – Russian border north of Kraków, and entered [[Congress Poland]]. However, the Pilsudski and his soldiers were disappointed to see that the inhabitants of Kielce did not welcome them with joy.<ref>[http://www.niepodleglosc.lodzkie.eu/page/index.php?str=35] "W Kielcach ludnoÊç w panice zamyka∏a drzwi i okna przed wkraczajàcymi legionistami"</ref> The division of Lesser Poland was more visible than ever.
[[File:43. TKB - Fickowa Pokusa z Jeleśni 01.JPG|thumb|[[Gorals]] from [[Beskidy]].]]

During World War I, Lesser Poland became one of main theaters of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Russian push into the territory of Austria – Hungary resulted in the [[Battle of Galicia]]. Among other major battles which took place in Lesser Poland, there are the [[Battle of the Vistula River]], and the [[Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive]]. After Russian troops [[Great Retreat|had retreated east]], whole province was under control of the Austrians and the Germans, and northern Lesser Poland was part of the German-sponsored [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)]]. In later stages of the conflict, the divided province once again became a center of Polish independence movement. An independent Polish government was re-proclaimed in northern Lesser Poland's city of Lublin, on 7 November 1918. Soon afterwards, it formed the basis of the new government of the country.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stamp Domain |url=http://www.stampdomain.com/country/poland/poland1918/ |title=POSTAL HISTORY OF POLAND 1918 |publisher=Stampdomain.com |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> In other parts of the province, other governments were formed – [[Polish Liquidation Commission]] in Kraków, also the short-lived [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]].

The division of Lesser Poland along the Vistula river, which lasted from 1772 until 1918, is visible even today. For more than 100 years, southern Lesser Poland ([[Kraków]], [[Tarnów]], [[Bielsko-Biała|Biala Krakowska]], and [[Nowy Sącz]]) was administered by Austria, while northern, larger part of the province ([[Częstochowa]], [[Sosnowiec]], Kielce, Radom, Lublin, [[Sandomierz]]) was forcibly part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Inhabitants of Austrian part of Poland enjoyed limited autonomy,<ref>[http://www.jewish-guide.pl/galicia/37 Jewish Guide, Galicia]"Under the rule of emperor Franz Josef broad autonomy was granted to Galicia due to the political shrewdness and common sense of Polish intelligentsia."</ref> with Polish language institutions, such as [[Jagiellonian University]]. At the same time, Russian-controlled Poland was subject to [[Russification]]. As a result of decades of this division, most inhabitants of the areas stolen by Russia are not aware of their Lesser Poland's heritage. Furthermore, current administrative boundaries of the country still reflect the defunct border between the former Russian and Austria–Hungarian Empires.
[[File:Zamek Bobolice (Castle of Bobolice).JPG|thumb|Castle of [[Bobolice, Silesian Voivodeship|Bobolice]].]]

=== Interbellum Poland (1918–1939) ===
In 1918, when [[Second Polish Republic]] was created, whole historical Lesser Poland became part of restored [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. The historical area of the province was divided between four voivodeships: [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919-1939)|Kraków Voivodeship]] (whole), [[Kielce Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kielce Voivodeship]] (whole), [[Lwów Voivodeship]] (northwestern corner), and [[Lublin Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Lublin Voivodeship]] (western part). Furthermore, in the counties of central Lesser Poland, another administrative unit, [[Sandomierz Voivodeship (1939)|Sandomierz Voivodeship]] was planned, but due to the outbreak of World War II, it was never created. Boundaries between two major Lesser Poland voivodeships – Kraków, and Kielce, were the same as pre-1914 boundaries of Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Nevertheless, in the interbellum period, the notion of Lesser Poland was frequently associated only with former Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]].<ref name="nowamalopolska.pl" /> Therefore, Western Galicia to the [[San (river)|San]] river, was called ''Western Lesser Poland'', while Eastern Galicia, east of the San, with the city of [[Lwów]], was called ''Eastern Lesser Poland'' (voivodeships of [[Tarnopol Voivodeship|Tarnopol]], [[Stanisławów Voivodeship|Stanisławów]], and [[Lwów Voivodeship|Lwów]]).

In late 1918, Lesser Poland emerged as one of main centers of fledgling Polish administration and independence movement. According to historian Kazimierz Banburski of Tarnow's District Museum, [[Tarnów|Tarnow]] was the first Polish city which became independent, after 123 years of [[Partitions of Poland|oppression]]. On 31 October 1918, at 8&nbsp;am, Tarnow's inhabitants began disarming demoralized Austrian soldiers, and after three hours, the city was completely in Polish hands.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marek Ciesielczyk |url=http://interia360.pl/artykul/tarnow-byl-pierwszym-niepodleglym-miastem-w-polsce,8913 |title=Tarnów był pierwszym niepodległym miastem w Polsce – Informacje w Interia360.pl – wiadomości, dziennikarstwo obywatelskie |publisher=Interia360.pl |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> On 28 October 1918, [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] was created in Kraków. A few days later, socialist peasants founded the [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]]. In the night of 6/7 November 1918, ''Polish People's Republic'' was proclaimed in Lublin, by [[Ignacy Daszynski]] and other activists. In 1919, [[Polish legislative election, 1919|the legislative election]] took place in Lesser Poland without major problems.

[[File:Wieliczka salt mine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wieliczka Salt Mine]].]]

At that time Lesser Poland, like other provinces of the country, faced several problems. Even though major post-World War One conflicts (such as [[Polish–Soviet War]]) did not take place there, it suffered from unemployment, overpopulation, and poverty, especially in towns and countryside. Furthermore, Polish government had to connect parts of the hitherto divided country. There was no direct rail link between Kraków, and Kielce, Radom, and Lublin, and until 1934, when line from Kraków to [[Tunel (railroad station)|Tunel]] was opened, all travelers had to go via [[Sosnowiec]] – Maczki. Lack of rail communication between former Austrian and former Russian parts of Lesser Poland is visible even today. Between Kraków and [[Deblin]], there are only two rail bridges along the Vistula. Residents of the province tried to improve their conditions using legal means, but when it turned out to be impossible, they took to fighting ([[1923 Kraków riot]], [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]). As if to exacerbate the desperate situation, Lesser Poland witnessed [[1934 flood in Poland|a catastrophic flood]] in 1934, after which the government decided to construct dams on local rivers.

Even though Lesser Poland's countryside was almost exclusively Polish, its towns and cities were inhabited by numerous [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]], whose communities were very vibrant. In Kraków, Jews made 25% of the population, in Lublin – 31%, in Kielce – 30%, and in Radom – 32%. Apart from the Jews, and Gypsies scattered in the south, there were no other significant national minorities in interbellum Lesser Poland.

Since Lesser Poland was safely located in the middle of the country, away from both German and Soviet border, in the mid-1930s Polish government initiated one of the most ambitious project of the Second Polish Republic – [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which was located almost exclusively in Lesser Poland. Even though the project was never completed, several plants were constructed, both in [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]], and in other counties of the province. The brand new city of Stalowa Wola was established in dense forests, around a [[Huta Stalowa Wola|steel mill]]. In the late 1930s, Lesser Poland was quickly changing, as construction of several factories, and job opportunities caused influx of rural inhabitants to the towns. Such towns, as [[Debica]], [[Starachowice]], [[Puławy]], or [[Krasnik]], quickly grew, with their population rising. Earlier, in 1927, Lesser Poland's [[Deblin]] became a major center of Polish aviation, when [[Polish Air Force Academy]] was opened there, and in [[Mielec]], [[PZL Mielec]] was opened, which was the largest aerospace manufacturer in Poland. Central Industrial Region, however, did not affect western counties of Lesser Poland, which had already been urbanized and industrialized ([[Bielsko-Biała|Biala Krakowska]], [[Zywiec]], [[Kraków]], [[Jaworzno]], [[Zaglebie Dabrowskie]], [[Zawiercie]], and [[Częstochowa]]). The government of Poland planned further investments, such as a major East – West rail line, linking [[Volhynia]], and [[Upper Silesia]], but they never materialized. Desperate situation and lack of jobs caused thousands of inhabitants of Lesser Poland (especially from its southern part) to leave their land, mostly for the United States of America,<ref>{{cite web|author=hlclark |url=http://ellis-island-immigration.com/ellis-island-immigrants-italian-irish-and-polish/ |title=Ellis Island Immigrants: Italian, Irish and Polish – Ellis Island Immigration |publisher=Ellis-island-immigration.com |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> but also [[Brazil]], and Canada.

[[File:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope [[John Paul II]] was born in [[Wadowice]], Lesser Poland, in 1920]]

Lesser Poland remained a center of Polish culture, with Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]], [[AGH University of Science and Technology]], and [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]], which was opened in 1918. Several important figures of interbellum political, military, and cultural life of Poland were born in Lesser Poland. Among them were [[Wincenty Witos]], [[Wladyslaw Sikorski]], [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]], [[Józef Haller]], [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]], [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]], [[Feliks Koneczny]], [[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Tadeusz Peiper]], [[Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Jan Kiepura]], [[Stefan Jaracz]]. In 1920, in Lesser Poland's town of [[Wadowice]], [[Karol Wojtyla]], the future Pope John Paul II, was born.

=== World War II ===
On 1 September 1939, armed forces of Nazi Germany attacked Poland (see: [[Invasion of Poland]]). Lesser Poland, due to its proximity to the then-border with Germany, became a battleground on the first day of the invasion. The Germans attacked the province both in its northwest (area west of Częstochowa), and in the south ([[Podhale]]), along the border with [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], [[Third Reich]]’s ally.

Lesser Poland was defended by the following Polish armies:

* [[Karpaty Army]], which covered southern, mountainous border of the province,
* [[Kraków Army]], guarding western part of the province, together with adjacent Polish part of [[Upper Silesia]]. Later in the course of war it joined the Karpaty Army, forming the ''Lesser Poland Army'' (''Armia Małopolska''),
* [[Łódź Army]], which protected extreme northwestern corner of the province, north of Częstochowa,
* [[Prusy Army]], which was main reserve of the Commander in Chief, and was concentrated in central and northern Lesser Poland (between Radom and Kielce),
* [[Lublin Army]], improvised after 4 September, and concentrated in the area of Lublin and Sandomierz in northeastern Lesser Poland.
[[File:Brygada Świętokrzyska 1945.jpg|right|thumb|Soldiers of [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]] in parade 1945.]]
After a few days the [[Battle of the Border]] was lost, and forces of German [[Army Group South]] advanced deep into Lesser Poland’s territory. Polish troops resisted fiercely, and among major battles in initial stages of the war, which took place in Lesser Poland, there are [[Battle of Mokra]], [[Battle of Jordanów]], and [[Battle of Węgierska Górka]]. By 6 September, Polish forces were in general retreat and Marshal of Poland [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] ordered all troops to fall back to the secondary lines of defences at the Vistula and [[San (river)|San]] Rivers. German units entered Częstochowa on 3 September (where on the next day they [[Częstochowa massacre|murdered hundreds of civilians]]), Kielce on 5 September, Kraków on 6 September, and Radom on 8 September (see also [[Battle of Radom]]). Within a week, almost whole Lesser Poland was under Nazi occupation. Northeastern part of the province, the area of Lublin, was held by the Poles until 17 September, but eventually, and after fierce battles (see [[Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski]]), all Lesser Poland was firmly under Nazi control. First draft of [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] stipulated that northeastern Lesser Poland (east of the Vistula river) was to be occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], and forces of the [[Red Army]] reached the area of Lublin after 20 September, but withdrew east on 28 September.

On 12 October 1939, upon a decree of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[General Government]], a separate region of the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]] was created, with [[Hans Frank]] as its [[Governor-General]]. Its capital was established in Kraków, and it covered most of the area of historical Lesser Poland, except for its western counties, which were directly incorporated into Nazi Germany’s [[Upper Silesia Province]] ([[Będzin]], [[Sosnowiec]], [[Zawiercie]], [[Bielsko-Biala|Biala]], [[Żywiec]], [[Chrzanów]], [[Olkusz]]).

{{Further|Administrative division of Polish territories during World War II}}

In Lesser Poland, like in all provinces of the occupied country, the Nazis ruled with savage brutality, killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, both Polish and Jewish (see: [[World War II crimes in Poland]], [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)]], [[Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland]], [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles]], [[German AB-Aktion in Poland]], [[Sonderaktion Krakau]]). The [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], located at the border of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia, was opened on 14 June 1940, and on 1 October 1941, the Germans opened [[Majdanek concentration camp]] on the outskirts of Lublin. The third concentration camp in Lesser Poland was in [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Kraków's district of Płaszów]]. In late 1939 and early 1940, in Lesser Poland’s spa of [[Zakopane]], and in Kraków, several [[Gestapo–NKVD Conferences]] took place, during which the mutual cooperation between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union was discussed.

Anti-Nazi resistance was particularly strong in Lesser Poland, and it was in the extreme northwestern corner of the province (around Opoczno), that armed struggle against the occupiers began in late 1939 and early 1940 (see [[Henryk Dobrzański]]). Structures of the [[Home Army]] were well-developed in the region. Lesser Poland’s independent areas of the Home Army were located in Kraków, Kielce-Radom, and Lublin. During [[Operation Tempest]] in mid-1944, several Lesser Poland’s towns were liberated, also [[Kraków Uprising (1944)|uprising in Kraków]] was prepared, but never realized. Apart from the Home Army, other resistance groups were strong in the province, such as pro-Communist [[Armia Ludowa]], peasant’s [[Bataliony Chłopskie]], and right-wing [[National Armed Forces]], with its [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]].

In all major Lesser Poland’s cities, Jewish ghettos were opened, with the biggest ones in [[Kraków Ghetto|Kraków]], and [[Lublin Ghetto|Lublin]]. At first the Nazis were planning to create a so-called “reservation” for European Jews, located around Lesser Poland’s town of [[Nisko]] (see [[Nisko Plan]]), but they changed the plan, and decided to murder all Jews. Condemned to death, Jews in Lesser Poland took to fighting (see [[Częstochowa Ghetto Uprising]]), but their efforts failed. As a result of [[The Holocaust in Poland]], once thriving and numerous Jewish population of Lesser Poland was decimated.

In the summer of 1944, after [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]], Red Army pushed the Wehrmacht from eastern Lesser Poland. The city of Lublin was captured by the Soviets on 22 July 1944, Stalowa Wola – on 1 August, and Sandomierz, on the left bank of the Vistula – on 18 August. The front line stabilized along the Vistula for about six months (with some bridgeheads on the western bank on the Vistula – see [[Battle of Studzianki]]), and in early 1945, Soviet [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] began, which pushed Germans to the gates of Berlin. The Soviets entered Kielce on 15 January, Częstochowa – on 17 January, and Kraków on 19 January. On 27 January, the Red Army entered Sosnowiec. In took the Soviets much longer to clear the areas in the mountains – they did not enter Żywiec until 5 April 1945.<ref name="nsik.com.pl">{{cite web|url=http://www.nsik.com.pl/archiwum/38/a1.html |title=Wyzwolenie ziemi żywieckiej i realizacja planu AK "Burza" |publisher=Nsik.com.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>

=== Post World War II ===
Together with the Red Army, [[NKVD]] and Soviet authorities followed, whose purpose was to make Poland a Communist country, with a puppet government, formed as [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]. Since 1 August 1944, the provisional government was officially headquartered in Lesser Poland’s Lublin. Thousands of people took to the forests, to continue their fight for free Poland (see [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)]]). Lesser Poland again was one of the main centers of the resistance. Several skirmishes took place in the province, including [[Battle of Kuryłówka]]. The Communists did not hesitate to kill those rebels they captured ([[Public execution in Dębica (1946)]]), and by 1947, the resistance movement was crushed. The last Polish [[Cursed soldiers|cursed soldier]], [[Józef Franczak]], was killed in 1963 near [[Swidnik]] in northeastern Lesser Poland. Also, all victims of the [[1951 Mokotów Prison execution]] were members of Lesser Poland’s branch of [[Freedom and Independence]]. Another well-known anti-Communist fighter from Lesser Poland is [[Józef Kuraś]], who was active in the southern region of [[Podhale]].

In early 1945, the lands of Lesser Poland were divided between three voivodeships – those of Kraków, Lublin, and Kielce. Since summer 1945, several counties were transferred to neighboring voivodeships – eastern Lesser Poland (Debica, Jaslo, Mielec) became part of [[Rzeszow Voivodeship]], while western counties of Bedzin and Zawiercie were transferred to [[Katowice Voivodeship]]. In 1950, the city of Częstochowa became part of Katowice Voivodeship, and next year, the city of [[Bielsko-Biała]] was created out of Lesser Poland’s Biala Krakowska, and Upper Silesia’s Bielsko. The new city became part of Katowice Voivodeship. Lesser Poland was further divided in 1975, when territorial reform was carried out (see [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975-1988)]]). Counties were abolished, and several small voivodeships were created, in such Lesser Poland’s towns and cities, as Tarnobrzeg, Tarnow, Nowy Sącz, Bielsko-Biała, Radom, Częstochowa, and Siedlce.

The government of Communist Poland invested in heavy industry, following the pre-1939 idea of Central Industrial Area. In Kraków, a new district of [[Nowa Huta]] was constructed in the 1950s. In Częstochowa and Zawiercie, the steelworks were significantly expanded, and in early 1970, the government initiated construction of Katowice Steelworks, which, despite its name, is located in Lesser Poland’s [[Dabrowa Gornicza]]. To connect Katowice Steelworks with Soviet plants, in late 1970s [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]] was opened, which crossed Lesser Poland from west to east. Among other major factories, opened in Lesser Poland during Communist rule, there are:
* [[FSC Lublin]], opened in 1951,
* [[FSC Star]] in [[Starachowice]], opened in 1948, and based on earlier factory,
* [[PZL-Świdnik]], opened in 1951,
* Zaklady Azotowe [[Pulawy]], opened in 1965,
* [[Połaniec Power Station]], opened in 1979,
* Skawina Power Station, opened in 1957,
* Nowiny Cement Plant, opened in 1960,
* [[Kozienice Power Station]], opened in 1973.

[[File:Star 25 1 d.jpg|thumb|1971 Star 25 Firetruck, made in Star Factory in Lesser Poland's Starachowice]]

Other Lesser Poland’s major plants were significantly expanded after 1945, including [[Żywiec Brewery]], [[Okocim Brewery]], [[Fablok]], [[Łucznik Arms Factory]], [[FŁT-Kraśnik]], [[Jaworzno Power Station]], Siersza Power Plant, [[Huta Stalowa Wola]], [[Janina Coal Mine]], [[Sobieski Coal Mine]], Zaklady Azotowe Tarnów-Mościce. Furthermore, in early 1950s significant [[sulfur]] resources were discovered in Tarnobrzeg, as a result of which Siarkopol company was founded, and the city of Tarnobrzeg quickly grew. In 1975, coal was discovered northeast of Lublin, and soon afterwards, [[Bogdanka Coal Mine]] and [[Piaski Coal Mine]] were opened.

Between 1971 and 1977, [[Central Rail Line (Poland)|Central Trunk Line]] was opened, which goes along western boundary of the province, and which connects Kraków and Katowice, with Warsaw. In the early 1980s, construction of a highway between Kraków and Katowice began. The 61-kilometer road is now ran by Stalexport Autostrada Małopolska, and is part of [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 highway]].

Residents of Lesser Poland frequently protested against Communist government. Major centers of anti-Communist resistance were in Kraków, Nowa Huta, Radom, and Lublin. Among major protests that took place in the province were [[1968 Polish political crisis]] (with Kraków as one of major centers of protests), [[June 1976 protests]] (in Radom), [[Lublin 1980 strikes]], [[31 August 1982 demonstrations in Poland]] (in several locations), [[1988 Polish strikes]] (with Stalowa Wola as one of major centers). Several anti-Nazi, and anti-Communist leaders hailed from Lesser Poland: [[Jan Piwnik]], [[Emil August Fieldorf]], [[Leopold Okulicki]], [[Ryszard Siwiec]], [[Stanisław Pyjas]], [[Hieronim Dekutowski]], [[Andrzej Gwiazda]], [[Andrzej Czuma]].

A number of key personalities of Communist government were born in Lesser Poland, including [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]], [[Bolesław Bierut]], [[Edward Gierek]], [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], [[Czesław Kiszczak]], [[Stanisław Kania]], [[Hilary Minc]], [[Edward Ochab]], [[Michał Rola-Żymierski]], [[Józef Oleksy]].

Among prominent personalities of Polish cultural life of the 20th century, who were born in Lesser Poland, there are: [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Gustaw Herling-Grudziński]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Jan Kanty Pawluśkiewicz]], [[Marek Kondrat]], [[Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Zbigniew Preisner]], [[Leon Schiller]], [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Jan Sztaudynger]], [[Grzegorz Turnau]], [[Jerzy Turowicz]].

In 1998, the government of Poland carried out administrative reform of the country. For the first time in history, [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] was created, with capital in Kraków, and area of 15,108 square kilometers. The new province covers only a small, southwestern part of historical Lesser Poland.

Today, Lesser Poland is divided between several voivodeships: whole Lesser Poland Voivodeship, whole [[Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship]], western half of [[Lublin Voivodeship]], western part of [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]], eastern half of [[Silesian Voivodeship]], southern part of [[Mazovian Voivodeship]] and southeastern corner of [[Łódź Voivodeship]] (around [[Opoczno]]).

There were suggestions that Lesser Poland voivodeship should stretch from [[Bielsko-Biała]], to [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]] and [[Sandomierz]]. Furthermore, creation of [[Old Poland Voivodeship]] was proposed, on the historical lands of northern Lesser Poland. Also, since about half of territory of current Silesian Voivodeship belongs to historical Lesser Poland, there are suggestions to rename it into ''Silesian – Lesser Poland Voivodeship''.<ref>[http://www.zachodniamalopolska.republika.pl/] "Poprawna nazwa powinna więc brzmieć: Województwo Śląsko-Małopolskie"</ref>

In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], several other locations used to be important urban centers of Lesser Poland, but in the course of the time, their significance declined. The main example is [[Sandomierz]], which for hundreds of years was one of the most important cities of Poland,<ref>[http://www.staypoland.com/about_sandomierz.htm StayPoland page on Sandomierz]"At one time it played a role of great importance in the life of the country, but nowadays it is simply a rural town of great beauty"</ref> but now is a town of 25,000. Other examples of historically important places, which are now little towns or villages are:
* [[Biecz]], a town of 5,000, once the seat of a [[Biecz County|county]], incorporated in 1257,

== Economy and industry ==
History of industry in Lesser Poland goes back to prehistoric times, when in [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]], first [[bloomery|bloomeries]] were constructed. In the Middle Ages, first plants were opened in that area, and as a result, [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] was created, which was a major industrial region of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In the 17th century, first Polish [[blast furnace]]s were constructed in [[Samsonów]] by Italian engineer Hieronim Caccio. Apart from iron products, used for military purposes, Old-Polish Industrial Region also manufactured [[charcoal]] and glass. In 1782, in Poland there were 34 bloomeries, out of which 27 were located in Old-Polish Industrial Region. Another major industrial area of Lesser Poland is [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], where in the 16th century, lead, silver, and [[zinc]] were found. As early as in the 15th century, coal was exctracted in [[Trzebinia]] – Siersza, and in the following centuries, especially in the 19th century, several coal mines and steel mills were opened in Zagłębie and in Zagłębie Krakowskie (first coal mine in [[Jaworzno]] was opened in 1792). In nearby [[Olkusz]], the history of zinc mining dates to the 12th century when Casimir II the Just set up a mining settlement. Also, in the towns of [[Wieliczka]] and [[Bochnia]], salt mines were established in the 12th and 13th centuries (see [[Bochnia Salt Mine]], [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]]).

In the 20th century, natural resources were also discovered in central and eastern counties Lesser Poland.
In 1964, the world’s largest open-pit sulfur mine was opened in Machów near [[Tarnobrzeg]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Kutney| first = Gerald| title = Sulfur: History, Technology, Applications and Industry| url = http://books.google.com/?id=O4rzzkUQyzIC&pg=PA131| year = 2007| publisher = ChemTec Publishing| isbn = 978-1-895198-37-9| page = 131 }}</ref> Other sulfur deposits in the area of Tarnobrzeg are Jeziorko, Grzybów-Gacki, and Grębów-Wydza. The mine at Machów is now closed. In the late 1960s, eastern Lesser Poland became one of three coal basins of the country, when Lublin Basin was created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1324649.html |title=Resources of hard coal in Polish coal basins |publisher=Cprm.gov.br |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Major coal mine in the area is [[Bogdanka Coal Mine|KWK Bogdanka]] near [[Łęczna]], which is the only coal mine in Poland which has continuously generated a profit. Other Polish coal mines located in Lesser Poland are those found in western part of the province, along the boundary with Upper Silesia – [[Janina Coal Mine|KWK Janina]] in Jaworzno, [[Sobieski Coal Mine|KWK Sobieski]], and also in Jaworzno. Copper and silver are extracted in [[Myszków]] (see [[Myszków mine]]).

In the late 1930s, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] created [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which was almost exclusively located in Lesser Poland. Currently, within borders of the province, there are following [[industrial region]]s:
* ''Bielsko Industrial Region'' (''Bielski Okręg Przemysłowy''), which includes both towns from Lesser Poland, and Upper Silesia ([[Andrychów]], [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Cieszyn]], [[Kęty]], [[Pszczyna]], [[Skoczów]], Żywiec),
* ''Częstochowa Industrial Region'' (''Częstochowski Okręg Przemysłowy''), which includes Częstochowa, [[Myszków]], and [[Zawiercie]].
* [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] (''Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy''). Despite the name, it also includes cities from Lesser Poland’s [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] – Sosnowiec, [[Będzin]], [[Czeladź]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Wojkowice]],
* ''Jaworzno – Chrzanów Industrial Region'' (''Jaworznicko-Chrzanowski Okręg Przemysłowy''), with the towns of Jaworzno, [[Chrzanów]], [[Trzebinia]], [[Libiąż]], [[Chełmek]], [[Bukowno]], [[Alwernia]], [[Krzeszowice]],
* ''Carpathian Industrial Region'' (''Karpacki Okręg Przemysłowy''), which stretches from [[Nowy Sącz]], through [[Jasło]] and [[Gorlice]], to [[Sanok]],
* ''Kraków Industrial Region'' (''Krakowski Okręg Przemysłowy'') – the city of Kraków and the towns of [[Wieliczka]], [[Skawina]], [[Myślenice]], [[Bochnia]],
* '' Lublin Industrial Region'' (''Lubelski Okręg Przemysłowy'') – the city of Lublin and the towns of [[Świdnik]], [[Puławy]], [[Łęczna]],
* ''Tarnobrzeg Industrial Area'' (''Tarnobrzeski Okręg Przemysłowy'') – [[Stalowa Wola]], [[Tarnobrzeg]], [[Nisko]], [[Staszów]], [[Janów Lubelski]], [[Gorzyce, Tarnobrzeg County|Gorzyce]], [[Połaniec]], [[Mielec]],
* ''Tarnów – Rzeszów Industrial Region'' (''Tarnowsko-Rzeszowski Okręg Przemysłowy''), which stretches from Tarnów to Rzeszów, with such towns, as [[Dębica]], [[Niedomice]], [[Sędziszów Małopolski]], [[Ropczyce]].

In 2009, [[Polityka]] weekly made its own list of 500 biggest Polish companies. According to the list, second biggest company of the country was [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna]], which, as Polityka stated, is headquartered in Lublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lista500.polityka.pl/rankings/show |title=Lista 500 największych polskich firm – Lista 500 – Polityka.pl |publisher=Lista500.polityka.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Third biggest company of Poland in 2009 was ''[[Fiat]] Auto Poland'' from Bielsko-Biała. Other Lesser Polish companies which ranked high were: ''[[BP|BP Poland]]'' from Kraków (ranked 12th), ''Emperia Holding'' from Lublin (ranked 26th), [[Kolporter Holding]] from Kielce (ranked 43rd), and [[Żywiec Brewery]] (ranked 44th). Other major companies of Lesser Poland are ''Azoty Tarnów'', [[Bank BPH]], [[Bogdanka Coal Mine]], [[Carlsberg Polska]], [[Comarch]], ''Dębica SA'', ''Huta Częstochowa'', ''Huta Katowice'', [[Fablok]], [[FŁT-Kraśnik]], [[Huta Stalowa Wola]], ''Instal-Lublin'', [[Janina Coal Mine]], [[Jaworzno Power Station]], [[Kozienice Power Station]], [[Łucznik Arms Factory]], ''Nowiny Cement Plant'' near Kielce, [[Połaniec Power Station]], [[PZL Mielec]], [[PZL-Świdnik]], [[Sobieski Coal Mine]], [[Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks]].

Since the lands of historical Lesser Poland belong now to different voivodeships, unemployment rate differs from one region to another. In January 2010, in Poland the unemployment rate was 12,7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gus.pl/wiadomosc/20100302/bezrobotni-oraz-stopa-bezrobocia-wg-wojewodztw-styczen-2010 |title=Bezrobotni oraz stopa bezrobocia wg województw, styczeń 2010 &#124; GUS.PL – Wiadomości Ekonomiczne i Statystyczne |publisher=GUS.PL |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> In Silesian Voivodeship, eastern half of which is Lesser Poland, it was 9,9%, in Lesser Poland Voivodeship – 10,5%, in Subcarpathian Voivodeship – 16,3%, in Holy Cross Voivodeship – 15,5%, in Lublin Voivodeship – 13,6%, and in Mazovian Voivodeship (southern part of which is Lesser Poland) – 9,6%. In Lesser Poland's cities, the best situation was in Kraków (as for November 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rynekpracy.pl/monitor_rynku_pracy_1.php/wpis.56 |title=Job market in Poland. Unemployment in Polish cities |publisher=Rynekpracy.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>), where 4,1% had no job. In Bielsko-Biała, the rate was 5,7%, in Lublin – 8,8%, in Siedlce – 9,1%, in Tarnów – 9,2%, in Nowy Sącz – 10%, in Kielce and Częstochowa – 10,1%, in Jaworzno – 10,2%, in Dąbrowa Górnicza – 10,3%, in Sosnowiec – 12,2%, and in Tarnobrzeg – 14,3%. The worst situation on the job market (as for November 2009) was in Radom, where unemployment rate was 20,9% (it made Radom second worst city county of the nation, only after [[Grudziądz]]).

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Several European roads (see [[International E-road network]]) cross Lesser Poland. The most important one is the [[European route E40]], which goes from west to east, across whole Europe. In Lesser Poland, the E40 goes from Jaworzno, via Kraków and Tarnów, towards eastern border of the country. Another main European road in Lesser Poland is the [[European route E77|E77]], which goes from north to south, via Radom, Kielce and Kraków, to southern border of Poland at [[Chyżne]]. Third major European road in Lesser Poland is the [[European route E30|E30]], which crosses the territory of the province in its extreme northeast corner, in [[Siedlce]]. Apart from these roads, Lesser Poland is crossed by the following European routes:
* [[European route E371|E371]], which begins in Radom, and goes via Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Tarnobrzeg, and Rzeszów to the border crossing at [[Barwinek, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Barwinek]],
* [[European route E372|E372]], which begins in [[Warsaw]], and via northeastern Lesser Poland (Lublin, Świdnik), goes to Ukrainian border at [[Hrebenne, Tomaszów Lubelski County|Hrebenne]],
* [[European route E462|E462]], which goes through southwestern corner of the province, from Czech border and Bielsko-Biała, to [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice]],
* [[European route E75|E75]], which crosses western counties of Lesser Poland – from Częstochowa, through Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno, to Bielsko-Biała and Polish – Czech border.

=== Airports ===
Within borders of historical Lesser Poland, there are two airports – John Paul II International Airport Kraków – Balice, and [[Katowice International Airport]], which is located in the village of [[Pyrzowice]], on the border between Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia. Pyrzowice is part of [[Gmina Ożarowice]], which after [[Partitions of Poland]], and [[Congress of Vienna]] belonged to [[Będzin County]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In the interbellum, the area of future airport belonged to Lesser Poland’s [[Kielce Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kielce Voivodeship]], and in 1945, was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (initially ''Silesian-Dąbrowa Voivodeship''). In 1998, Ożarowice, together with the airport, was attached to [[Tarnowskie Góry County]], despite the fact that it is not located in Upper Silesia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starostwo.bedzin.pl/default.aspx?docId=2144 |title=History of Będzin County |publisher=Starostwo.bedzin.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>

Further airports in Lesser Poland will be opened in the future – Lublin – Świdnik,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airport.lublin.pl/en/index.php?id_kategorii=12&lang=_en |title=Official webpage of Lublin Airport |publisher=Airport.lublin.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Kielce – Obice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionpoland.com/40816/Local-authorities-begin-buying-up-real-estate-for-Kielce-Obice-airport.shtml |title=Local authorities begin buying up real estate for Kielce-Obice airport – Public investments – Construction market in Poland and Eastern Europe |publisher=Constructionpoland.com |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> and Radom – Sadków.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lotnisko-radom.eu/eng/indexm.php?r=21 |title=Airport Radom SA |publisher=Lotnisko-radom.eu |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Also, [[Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport]] is located on eastern border of the province.

=== Railroads ===
Railroad network of Lesser Poland is very unevenly distributed. It is very dense in the west, along the border with Upper Silesia, and sparse in the east, especially along the Vistula, and around Lublin. All major cities of the province are connected with each other, however traveling from Kraków to Lublin is time-consuming, as trains have to take an extended route, via Kielce, Radom, and Dęblin. Also, there is no direct connection between Tarnów and Kielce, as these cities belonged to different countries before 1918. Underdevelopment of the railroads in northern and eastern Lesser Poland is the result of the policy of the Russian Empire. For military reasons, the Russians were not interested in construction of a dense network of lines along the border with Germany and Austria-Hungary, allowing only the construction of narrow-gauge connections.{{sfn|Jezierski|Leszczyńska|2003|p=197}} Along the Vistula, between Kraków and Dęblin (the distance of some 320 kilometers), there are only four rail bridges – in Dęblin (rebuilt after the war, in 1947<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-deblin,226,.html |title=Most kolejowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>), in Sandomierz (built in 1928<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-sandomierz,228,.html |title=Most kolejowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>), in Tarnobrzeg-Nagnajów (built in 1961, together with a road bridge<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-drogowy-nagnajow,231,.html |title=Most drogowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>), and in [[Zaduszniki, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Zaduszniki]] (built in 1979 for the [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-lhs-zaduszniki,230,.html |title=Most kolejowy LHS |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>). In Kraków itself, there are three rail bridges over the Vistula.

Among rail hubs of Lesser Poland, there are Bielsko-Biała, [[Chabówka]], Częstochowa, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Dębica, Dęblin, Jaworzno-[[Szczakowa]], [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona (PKP station)|Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona]], Kielce, [[Koniecpol]], [[Kozłów, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Kozłów]], Kraków, Lublin, [[Łuków]], [[Muszyna]], Nowy Sącz, Oświęcim, Siedlce, [[Spytkowice, Wadowice County|Spytkowice]], [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]], Stalowa Wola, [[Stróże, Nowy Sącz County|Stróże]], [[Sucha Beskidzka]], Radom, Tarnów, [[Trzebinia]], [[Tunel (railroad station)|Tunel]], Zawiercie, and [[Żywiec]].

In the late 1970s, the Communist government built the broad-gauge [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]], which crosses Lesser Poland from west to east along the Vistula.

== Tourism and nature ==

== Education ==

=== Universities ===
Lesser Poland is home to Poland's oldest university – Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]], which was established in 1364. For centuries, it was the only college of the province, and of the whole country. In December 1918, [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]] was opened, becoming second university of Lesser Poland. In 1944, also in Lublin, [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]] was established.

=== Technical universities ===
There are several technical universities in Lesser Poland – Kraków's [[AGH University of Science and Technology]], and [[Cracow University of Technology|University of Technology]], as well as [[University of Bielsko-Biała]], [[Częstochowa University of Technology]], [[Lublin University of Technology]], [[Kazimierz Pułaski Technical University of Radom]], and [[Kielce University of Technology]].

=== Other colleges ===
Future teachers may study at [[Pedagogical University of Cracow]], or [[Jan Długosz University]] in Częstochowa, and future physicians at [[Jagiellonian University Medical College]], and [[Medical University of Lublin]]. Other state colleges are [[Jan Kochanowski University]] in Kielce, [[Pontifical University of John Paul II]] in Kraków, [[Agricultural University of Cracow]], [[University of Life Sciences in Lublin]], and [[Cracow University of Economics]]. Unique in the country is the [[Polish Air Force Academy]], located in Dęblin. Among private colleges of Lesser Poland, there is [[Wyższa Szkoła Biznesu – National-Louis University]] in Nowy Sącz.

== Regional identity and culture ==
Since Lesser Poland ceased to exist as a unified region in the late 18th century, during the [[Partitions of Poland]], most of its inhabitants are not aware of their heritage. Even the residents of [[Jaworzno]], a city which for centuries belonged to Kraków Land and only in 1975 was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (see [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975–98)]]), are not familiar with their Lesser Polish roots. In a poll in April 2011, 57% of Jaworzno's inhabitants stated that their city is historically tied with Lesser Poland, but as many as 36% said their city is tied with Upper Silesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jaworzno.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/850152,tozsamosc-jaworzna-miasto-slaskie-malopolskie-a-moze,id,t.html |title=Tożsamość Jaworzna. Miasto śląskie, małopolskie, a może zagłębiowskie? |publisher=Jaworzno.naszemiasto.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Polish linguist [[Jan Miodek]] emphasizes the fact that linguistically, [[Będzin]] is closer to [[Myślenice]] than to [[Tarnowskie Góry]], only 20&nbsp;km away. Miodek wrote that even though Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland's Zagłębie Dąbrowskie are industrially and administratively tied, both regions are culturally and linguistically different from each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wojewodztwoslaskie.pl/index2.php?id=zaglebie_dabrowskie|title=Zagłębie Dąbrowskie (comment)|last=Miodek|first=Jan|quote=Zagłębie językowo przynależy do Małopolski, co oznacza, że pod tym względem bliżej jest z Będzina do – dajmy na to – Myślenic niż do oddalonych o 20 km Tarnowskich Gór|publisher=Województwo Śląskie|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref> Residents of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie are known for their dislike of Upper Silesians, whom they call ''hanysy'', while the Silesians call them ''gorole''. In recent years, more inhabitants of Zagłębie become aware of their Lesser Poland's heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zobaczslask.pl/indexp2.php?id=zaglebiedabrowskie|title=Zagłębie Dąbrowskie: Zagłębie to nie jest Śląsk!|publisher=ZobaczSlask|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref> Also, after [[Partitions of Poland]], when Austrian province of Galicia was created, the cities of [[Rzeszów]] and [[Przemyśl]], which are part of historical [[Red Ruthenia]], became to be associated with Lesser Poland. Therefore, currently the notion of Lesser Poland most commonly applies to the two voivodeships which in the past belonged to Austrian Empire – Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]<ref>[http://www.malopolskaturystyka.pl/miejscowosci/malopolska Lesser Poland Tourist Information] "Tak więc dziś mówiąc o Małopolsce, mówimy w zasadzie o dwóch województwach, które swoje siedziby mają w Krakowie i Rzeszowie, choć nazwę „małopolskie” zarezerwowano dla tego pierwszego"</ref>

Among several Lesser Poland's regional organizations, one of the most important is ''Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiatów Małopolski'' (''The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland''). It publishes a magazine called ''Wspólnota Małopolska'' (''Lesser Polish Community''), and every year it chooses a ''Lesser Polish Person of the Year'' (among winners are [[John Paul II]], [[Anna Dymna]], and [[Stanisław Dziwisz]]). ''The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland'' has over 120 members from four Polish voivodeships. Among members are cities of Kraków, Częstochowa, Bielsko-Biała, Tarnów, and Przemyśl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgpm.krakow.pl/sgpm/index.php|title=Stowarzyszenie|publisher=Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiatów Małopolski|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref>

Arguably, the most famous product of Lesser Polish cuisine is the [[bagel]], which was invented in Kraków. Other famous food specialties of the province are [[oscypek]] (EU [[Protected Geographical Status]]), [[slivovitz]] from the village of [[Łącko, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Łącko]], [[bublik]], papal cream cake from Wadowice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wadowice.com/viewpage.php?page_id=14 |title=The papal cake |publisher=Wadowice |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Lisiecka Sausage (EU [[Protected Geographical Status]]), and [[Bryndza Podhalańska]].

== Lesser Polish dialect of the Polish language ==
{{Further|Lesser Polish dialect}}
[[File:Polska-dialekty wg Urbańczyka.PNG|thumb|300px|A map of dialects of the Polish language. The area where Lesser Poland's dialect is spoken is marked in orange.]]

Lesser Polish dialect is spoken in southeastern corner of Poland, both in lands which belong to historical Lesser Poland, and in areas which are not part of the province (around [[Sieradz]] and [[Łęczyca]]). On the other hand, as seen on the map, Lesser Polish dialect is not spoken in extreme northeast of Lesser Poland, in [[Siedlce]] and vicinity, where people rather speak Masovian dialect. Descending from the language of the Vistulans, it is the most numerous dialectal group in modern Poland. According to [[Wincenty Pol]], it is divided into three subdivisions: Sandomierz dialect, Lublin dialect, and Sanok dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terazmalopolska.pl/dialekt-malopolski|title=Dialekt małopolski|publisher=Teraz Małopolska|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish}}</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Lesser Polish dialect, together with Greater Polish dialect, contributed to creation of standard Polish, it also greatly influenced [[Silesian language]] (see [[Dialects of the Polish language]]), as well as dialects of Polish used in southern part of [[Kresy Wschodnie]]. Later on, however, its importance diminished and was replaced by [[Masovian dialect]], which became the leading dialect of Polish. After [[Partitions of Poland]], when Lesser Poland was divided between Austria and Russia, northern areas of the province took over many features of the Masovian dialect, while Lesser Polish dialect in Austrian province of Galicia was heavily influenced by German.

According to Multimedia Guide to Polish Dialects, a webpage maintained by [[University of Warsaw]], Lesser Polish dialect is divided into the following subdialects:
* Mazowsze Borderland (Pogranicze Mazowsza – around Radom and Dęblin),
* Łęczyca (around [[Łódź]], [[Kutno]], [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]] – this part of the country is not historical Lesser Poland),
* Kielce (around Kielce),
* Lasowiacy (north of Rzeszów),
* East Kraków,
* West Lublin,
* East Lublin (this area historically belongs to [[Red Ruthenia]]),
* Przemyśl (historical part of Red Ruthenia),
* Biecz,
* Nowy Sącz,
* Podhale,
* Spisz,
* Orawa,
* Żywiec,
* Sieradz,
* Sanok region, or Red-Ruthenian<ref>Kształcenie językowe.
